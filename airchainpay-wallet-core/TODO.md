# AirChainPay Wallet-Core Security & Quality TODO

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

- [x] Refactor wallet-core to never store private keys in the Wallet struct or any loggable/debuggable struct. Store private keys only in secure storage (e.g., OS keychain, hardware enclave, or encrypted file).
- [x] Audit all FFI functions to ensure private keys are never exposed, passed as strings, or returned to the caller. Use secure key retrieval and zeroize memory after use.
- [x] Replace all uses of unwrap(), expect(), and direct panics with proper error handling and propagation throughout wallet-core, especially in FFI and cryptographic code.
- [x] Implement strong password validation (length, complexity, entropy) and enforce it everywhere passwords are used for wallet encryption or authentication.
- [x] Encrypt all private keys at rest using a strong, user-derived key (e.g., Argon2 or PBKDF2) and never store them in plaintext, even temporarily.
- [x] Remove or refactor all #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)] on structs that contain or could contain sensitive data (private keys, seed phrases, etc.).
- [x] Zeroize all sensitive data (private keys, seed phrases, decrypted secrets) immediately after use, and use the zeroize crate everywhere sensitive data is handled.
- [x] Complete and audit transaction signing and cryptographic operations to ensure no sensitive data is exposed, and all cryptographic best practices are followed.
- [x] Implement comprehensive input validation and output sanitization for all FFI and public API boundaries.

## üîí Security Architecture Improvements

### Key Management
- **SecurePrivateKey**: Now only stores a key ID reference, never the actual key bytes in memory
- **with_key() method**: Provides temporary access to key bytes for cryptographic operations without storing them
- **Secure storage**: All private keys are stored encrypted in secure storage backends
- **No Debug/Clone**: Removed dangerous derives that could expose keys in logs or when cloned

### Wallet Structs
- **Wallet & SecureWallet**: Removed Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize derives to prevent sensitive data exposure
- **WalletInfo**: New safe struct for serialization that contains no sensitive data
- **Zeroization**: All sensitive data is automatically zeroized when dropped

### FFI Security
- **No key exposure**: FFI functions never return private keys as strings
- **Secure operations**: All cryptographic operations use the with_key() pattern
- **Error handling**: Replaced unwrap()/expect() with proper error handling
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation of all FFI inputs

### Storage Security
- **Encrypted at rest**: All private keys are encrypted using Argon2 + AES-GCM
- **Password-derived keys**: Strong key derivation from user passwords
- **Secure backup**: Wallet backups contain no private keys, only encrypted metadata

## üöß Remaining Tasks

### Critical Security Fixes

- [ ] Harden BLE communication: implement full authentication, encryption, and device whitelisting to prevent MITM and unauthorized access.
- [ ] Review and fix all unsafe pointer operations and direct memory manipulation in FFI (e.g., ptr::copy_nonoverlapping), ensuring proper bounds checks and safe abstractions.
- [ ] Add security-focused tests: memory safety, FFI boundary fuzzing, and regression tests for all critical wallet-core operations.

### Platform-Specific Security

- [ ] Implement hardware-backed secure storage for iOS (Keychain) and Android (Keystore)
- [ ] Add biometric authentication support for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement secure enclave operations where available (iOS Secure Enclave, Android StrongBox)

### Production Readiness

- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for security events (without exposing sensitive data)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for cryptographic operations
- [ ] Add memory protection mechanisms (mprotect, etc.)
- [ ] Implement secure random number generation validation
- [ ] Add cryptographic algorithm validation and fallback mechanisms

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Add fuzzing tests for all cryptographic operations
- [ ] Implement memory safety tests using tools like Miri
- [ ] Add integration tests for secure storage backends
- [ ] Implement stress tests for concurrent operations
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for cryptographic operations

## üîê Security Principles Implemented

1. **Zero Trust**: Never trust any data from external sources
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access to sensitive data
4. **Secure by Default**: Safe defaults for all operations
5. **Fail Secure**: Operations fail safely when security cannot be guaranteed
6. **No Sensitive Data in Memory**: Private keys are never stored in memory structs
7. **Cryptographic Best Practices**: Industry-standard algorithms and protocols
8. **Audit Trail**: All security-relevant operations are logged (without sensitive data)
