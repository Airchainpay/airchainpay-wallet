/**
 * Bluetooth Testing Script
 * 
 * This script helps verify if the react-native-ble-plx library is properly configured
 * and can be used to test basic Bluetooth functionality.
 * 
 * To use this script:
 * 1. Run the app on a physical device
 * 2. Navigate to the BLE Payment screen
 * 3. Press "Scan BLE Devices" and observe if devices are found
 * 4. Check the app logs for any BLE-related errors
 * 
 * Common issues and solutions:
 * 
 * 1. Permission issues:
 *    - Ensure the app has requested and been granted Bluetooth permissions
 *    - For Android, check that location permissions are also granted
 * 
 * 2. Device compatibility:
 *    - Ensure the device supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
 *    - Some older devices may not support BLE or have limited functionality
 * 
 * 3. Service/Characteristic UUIDs:
 *    - The UUIDs in BLEPaymentScreen.tsx should match the ones used by the devices
 *    - Consider using a BLE scanner app to verify the UUIDs of your target devices
 * 
 * 4. Debugging:
 *    - Use console.log statements in the BluetoothManager.ts file to track BLE operations
 *    - For Android, check logcat for BLE-related messages
 * 
 * 5. Testing with known devices:
 *    - Use a known BLE device (like a fitness tracker or smart device) for testing
 *    - Consider creating a simple BLE peripheral app on another device for testing
