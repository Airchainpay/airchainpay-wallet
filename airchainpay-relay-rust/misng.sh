Critical Issues:
1. Compilation Failures (188 errors)
The codebase has significant compilation errors that prevent it from building:
Type mismatches between web3 and ethers libraries
Missing trait implementations for PartialEq, Serialize
API compatibility issues with Actix-web middleware
BLE manager implementation errors
Blockchain integration type conflicts


2. Architecture Issues
Mixed blockchain libraries: Using both web3 and ethers causing conflicts
Incomplete BLE implementation: Missing proper async/await patterns
Security middleware type system issues
Configuration management serialization problems
3. Missing Production Features
No proper error handling for critical paths
Incomplete authentication system
Missing rate limiting implementation
No circuit breaker patterns
Inadequate logging for production debugging
