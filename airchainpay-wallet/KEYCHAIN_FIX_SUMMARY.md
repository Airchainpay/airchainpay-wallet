# Keychain Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was showing the warning:
```
INFO [2025-07-19T07:32:48.250Z] [INFO] [SecureStorage] Keychain not supported on this device, using SecureStore fallback
```

This indicated that the hardware-backed keychain storage was not properly configured, causing the app to fall back to SecureStore for all sensitive data storage.

## Root Cause
The keychain was not working due to missing platform-specific configurations:

1. **iOS**: Missing keychain entitlements in the app's entitlements file
2. **Android**: Missing biometric permissions in the Android manifest
3. **App Config**: Missing react-native-keychain plugin configuration
4. **SecureStorage**: Basic keychain detection without proper testing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. iOS Entitlements (`ios/AirChainPayWallet/AirChainPayWallet.entitlements`)
```xml
<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
<array>
  <string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.airchainpay.wallet</string>
</array>
```
- Added keychain access groups entitlement
- Enables hardware-backed storage on iOS devices
- Required for react-native-keychain to work properly

### 2. Android Permissions (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT"/>
```
- Added biometric permissions for Android keystore access
- Enables hardware-backed storage on Android devices
- Required for react-native-keychain to work properly

### 3. App Configuration (`app.config.js`)
```javascript
android: {
  permissions: [
    // ... existing permissions
    "USE_BIOMETRIC",
    "USE_FINGERPRINT"
  ]
}
```
- Added biometric permissions to Expo configuration
- Ensures permissions are properly requested at runtime

### 4. Enhanced SecureStorage Detection (`src/utils/SecureStorageService.ts`)
- Improved keychain availability detection with actual testing
- Added test storage/retrieval to verify keychain functionality
- Better error handling and logging
- Proper fallback to SecureStore when keychain is unavailable

## Security Benefits

### Before Fix
- All sensitive data stored in SecureStore (software-based)
- Private keys potentially vulnerable to memory extraction
- No hardware-backed security

### After Fix
- **Hardware-backed storage** when keychain is available
- **Biometric authentication** support on compatible devices
- **Graceful fallback** to SecureStore when keychain unavailable
- **Enhanced security** for wallet private keys and seed phrases

## Testing

Run the test script to verify configuration:
```bash
npm run test-keychain
```

Expected output:
```
✅ iOS: Keychain entitlements properly configured
✅ Android: Biometric permissions properly configured
✅ App Config: Android biometric permissions included
✅ SecureStorage: Enhanced keychain detection implemented
✅ Dependencies: react-native-keychain installed
```

## Next Steps

1. **For iOS Development**:
   - Install Xcode if not already installed
   - Run `npx expo run:ios` to test on iOS simulator/device
   - Keychain should now work with hardware-backed storage

2. **For Android Development**:
   - Run `npx expo run:android` to test on Android emulator/device
   - Keychain should now work with Android keystore

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - The app will now use hardware-backed storage on supported devices
   - Falls back to SecureStore on unsupported devices
   - No more "Keychain not supported" warnings on compatible devices

## Files Modified

1. `ios/AirChainPayWallet/AirChainPayWallet.entitlements` - Added keychain entitlements
2. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added biometric permissions
3. `app.config.js` - Added biometric permissions to Expo config
4. `src/utils/SecureStorageService.ts` - Enhanced keychain detection
5. `package.json` - Added test scripts
6. `scripts/test-keychain.js` - Created test script
7. `scripts/fix-keychain.js` - Created fix script

## Verification

The keychain fix is complete and ready for testing. The app will now:
- Use hardware-backed storage when available
- Provide better security for wallet data
- Show appropriate logging instead of fallback warnings
- Support biometric authentication on compatible devices
