# BLE Receive Logic Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) transaction receiving functionality in the AirChainPay relay server. The implementation provides secure, authenticated, and monitored transaction processing from BLE devices.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **BLEManager** (`src/bluetooth/BLEManager.js`)
   - Handles BLE device connections and communication
   - Manages device authentication and key exchange
   - Implements DoS protection and rate limiting
   - Provides encryption/decryption for secure communication

2. **receiveTxViaBLE Function** (`src/server.js`)
   - Main transaction processing function
   - Validates transaction data and security
   - Integrates with blockchain processing
   - Provides comprehensive logging and audit trails

3. **Transaction Validator** (`src/validators/TransactionValidator.js`)
   - Validates transaction format and data integrity
   - Checks blockchain-specific requirements

4. **Transaction Processor** (`src/processors/TransactionProcessor.js`)
   - Handles actual blockchain transaction submission
   - Manages gas estimation and transaction confirmation

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Device authentication using public key cryptography
- Challenge-response authentication protocol
- Session key management for encrypted communication

### Authorization
- Device blocking for failed authentication attempts
- Rate limiting per device to prevent DoS attacks
- Temporary blacklisting for suspicious behavior

### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all BLE communication
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure session establishment
- Encrypted transaction data transmission

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging for all transactions
- Real-time monitoring of device connections
- Performance metrics and error tracking

## Implementation Details

### Transaction Flow

1. **Device Connection**
   ```
   Device connects → Authentication → Key Exchange → Ready for transactions
   ```

2. **Transaction Processing**
   ```
   Receive transaction → Validate → Security checks → Process → Confirm
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```
   Error occurs → Log details → Send error to device → Audit trail
   ```

### Key Functions

#### `receiveTxViaBLE(deviceId, transactionData)`

Main function for processing BLE transactions:

```javascript
async function receiveTxViaBLE(deviceId, transactionData) {
  // 1. Security validation
  // 2. Data validation
  // 3. Transaction processing
  // 4. Status reporting
  // 5. Audit logging
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `deviceId`: Unique identifier for the BLE device
- `transactionData`: Transaction object containing signed transaction and metadata

**Returns:**
- Success: `{ success: true, hash, blockNumber, gasUsed, timestamp }`
- Failure: `{ success: false, error, timestamp }`

### Security Checks

1. **Device Authentication**
   ```javascript
   if (bleManager && !bleManager.isDeviceAuthenticated(deviceId)) {
     return { success: false, error: 'Device not authenticated', requiresAuth: true };
   }
   ```

2. **Device Blocking**
   ```javascript
   if (bleManager && bleManager.isDeviceBlocked(deviceId)) {
     return { success: false, error: 'Device is blocked', deviceBlocked: true };
   }
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   if (bleManager && !bleManager.checkTransactionRateLimit(deviceId)) {
     return { success: false, error: 'Transaction rate limit exceeded', rateLimited: true };
   }
   ```

4. **Data Validation**
   ```javascript
   if (!transactionData.signedTransaction) {
     return { success: false, error: 'Missing signed transaction' };
   }
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```
Returns server status including BLE information.

### BLE Status
```
GET /ble/status
```
Returns detailed BLE status including:
- Connection counts
- Authentication status
- Blocked devices
- Performance metrics

### BLE Devices
```
GET /ble/devices
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
npm run test-ble-receive
```

### Test Coverage
