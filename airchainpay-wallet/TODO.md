## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES TO ADDRESS

### Private Key Storage (CRITICAL)
- [x] **Replace plain text SecureStore with hardware-backed storage**
  - Current: Private keys stored in plain text in React Native SecureStore
  - Risk: Keys can be extracted from device memory
  - Solution: Implement iOS Keychain Services and Android Keystore
  - Impact: Complete wallet compromise if device is compromised
  - **STATUS: FIXED** - Implemented SecureStorageService with hardware-backed storage using react-native-keychain

### Password Security (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Implement proper password hashing and salt**
  - Current: Passwords stored in plain text
  - Risk: Password exposure leads to wallet compromise
  - Solution: Use bcrypt or Argon2 with unique salts
  - Impact: Unauthorized wallet access

### BLE Security (HIGH)
- [ ] **Implement secure BLE pairing and encryption**
  - Current: No authentication or encryption for BLE connections
  - Risk: Man-in-the-middle attacks, device spoofing
  - Solution: Implement BLE Secure Simple Pairing (SSP)
  - Impact: Transaction interception and manipulation

### QR Code Tampering (HIGH)
- [ ] **Add digital signatures to QR code payloads**
  - Current: QR codes contain unsigned transaction data
  - Risk: Malicious QR codes can execute unauthorized transactions
  - Solution: Implement ECDSA signatures for QR code validation
  - Impact: Unauthorized fund transfers

### Gas Price Manipulation (HIGH)
- [ ] **Implement gas price validation and limits**
  - Current: No validation of gas prices in transactions
  - Risk: Excessive gas fees or front-running attacks
  - Solution: Add gas price bounds checking and estimation
  - Impact: Financial loss through high fees

### Network Status Spoofing (HIGH)
- [ ] **Implement secure network status detection**
  - Current: Relies on device network status
  - Risk: Malicious apps can spoof network status
  - Solution: Implement blockchain node connectivity checks
  - Impact: Offline transactions processed when online

### Memory Exposure (HIGH)
- [ ] **Implement secure memory handling for sensitive data**
  - Current: Private keys may remain in memory
  - Risk: Memory dumps can expose private keys
  - Solution: Use secure memory allocation and zeroing
  - Impact: Key extraction from device memory

### Transaction Replay Attacks (HIGH)
- [ ] **Implement nonce validation and replay protection**
  - Current: Basic nonce checking only
  - Risk: Transaction replay across networks
  - Solution: Add network-specific nonce tracking
  - Impact: Double-spending across different networks

### Input Validation (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Add comprehensive input sanitization**
  - Current: Limited input validation
  - Risk: Injection attacks and malformed data
  - Solution: Implement strict input validation and sanitization
  - Impact: App crashes and potential data corruption

### Sensitive Information Logging (MEDIUM)
- [ ] **Remove sensitive data from logs**
  - Current: Private keys and addresses may be logged
  - Risk: Log files expose sensitive information
  - Solution: Implement secure logging with data masking
  - Impact: Information disclosure through logs
