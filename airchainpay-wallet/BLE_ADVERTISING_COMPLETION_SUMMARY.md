   - Solution: Updated all method calls and validation logic

2. **Missing Features**:
   - Problem: Basic advertising without security, monitoring, or analytics
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive feature set

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Problem: Limited error handling and recovery
   - Solution: Comprehensive error handling with metrics and recovery

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Problem: No performance tracking or optimization
   - Solution: Full performance monitoring and analytics

### Architecture Improvements
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into specialized modules
- **Singleton Pattern**: Efficient resource management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with interfaces
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive metrics and analytics

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Advertising
```typescript
const result = await bleManager.startEnhancedAdvertising();
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Enhanced advertising started:', result.sessionId);
}
```

### Secure Advertising with Encryption
```typescript
const securityConfig = {
  enableEncryption: true,
  enableAuthentication: true,
  sessionTimeout: 1800000, // 30 minutes
  maxRetries: 3
};

const result = await bleManager.startSecureAdvertising(securityConfig);
```

### Get Comprehensive Statistics
```typescript
const stats = bleManager.getAdvertisingStatistics();
console.log('Basic Stats:', stats.basic);
console.log('Security Stats:', stats.security);
console.log('Monitoring Stats:', stats.monitoring);
```

### Generate Detailed Report
```typescript
const report = bleManager.getAdvertisingReport();
console.log(report);
```
